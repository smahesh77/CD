# Flex Program Explanation

This document explains a simple Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer) program that processes input strings, accepting all characters except the specific string "mahesh".

## Program Structure

A Flex program typically consists of three sections separated by '%%':
1. Definitions section
2. Rules section
3. C code section

Let's break down each section of the program:

## 1. Definitions Section

```c
%{
#include <stdio.h>
%}
```

This section is enclosed in '%{' and '%}'. It contains C code that will be copied verbatim to the generated C file. Here, we're including the stdio.h header for input/output operations.

## 2. Rules Section

```
%%

"mahesh"  { 
    // If "mahesh" is found, we won't print anything or accept this string
    printf("Not Accepted : %s\n",yytext);
}

.|\n { 
    // This rule will match any single character or newline
    // So, we print this character to indicate acceptance
    printf("Accepted character: %s\n", yytext);
}
```

This section contains pattern-action pairs. Each pair consists of a regular expression followed by C code in curly braces.

### First Rule:
- Pattern: "mahesh"
- Action: If the lexer encounters the exact string "mahesh", it prints "Not Accepted : mahesh"
- yytext is a Flex variable that contains the matched text

### Second Rule:
- Pattern: .|\n
- This is a catch-all rule. The dot (.) matches any single character except newline, and |\n adds newline to the match.
- Action: For any character (including newline) that isn't "mahesh", it prints "Accepted character: " followed by the matched character.

## 3. C Code Section

```c
%%

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Enter a string (Ctrl+D to end input):\n");
    yylex(); // Start the lexer
    return 0;
}

int yywrap() {
    return 1;
}
```

This section contains additional C code:

### main() function:
- Prints a prompt for the user to enter a string
- Calls yylex(), which is the main function of the lexer generated by Flex. This function reads input and executes the actions for matched patterns.

### yywrap() function:
- This is called by Flex when it reaches the end of the input
- Returning 1 tells the scanner that it's done and should terminate

## How it works

1. When you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a string.
2. It will then process the input character by character:
   - If it encounters the string "mahesh", it will print "Not Accepted : mahesh"
   - For any other character, it will print "Accepted character: " followed by that character
3. The program will continue to process input until it reaches the end of the file (EOF), which you can trigger by pressing Ctrl+D on Unix-like systems.

This program essentially creates a simple lexer that accepts all characters except the specific string "mahesh". It's a basic example of how Flex can be used to create custom lexical analyzers for more complex languages or text processing tasks.

## Complete Code

Here's the complete Flex program for reference:

```c
%{
#include <stdio.h>
%}

%%

"mahesh"  { 
    // If "mahesh" is found, we won't print anything or accept this string
    printf("Not Accepted : %s\n",yytext);
}

.|\n { 
    // This rule will match any single character or newline
    // So, we print this character to indicate acceptance
    printf("Accepted character: %s\n", yytext);
}

%% 

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Enter a string (Ctrl+D to end input):\n");
    yylex(); // Start the lexer
    return 0;
}

int yywrap() {
    return 1;
}
```

To use this program, you would need to:
1. Save it to a file with a .l extension (e.g., lexer.l)
2. Run it through Flex to generate a C file
3. Compile the generated C file
4. Run the resulting executable

This process might look like:

```bash
flex lexer.l
gcc lex.yy.c -o lexer
./lexer
```

Then you can input strings and see how the lexer processes them.
